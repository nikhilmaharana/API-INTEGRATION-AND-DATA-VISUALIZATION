## In this project, I developed a Python-based weather dashboard that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap public API and visualizes key weather parameters for seven major Indian cities—Bhubaneswar, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. The primary objective was to integrate a public API, process its JSON response, and create meaningful visualizations using Python libraries such as Pandas for data handling and Seaborn/Matplotlib for graphical representation, fulfilling the internship task requirements from CODTECH. To begin, the script sends HTTP requests to the API endpoint for each city using a valid API key, retrieves weather information including temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, and converts the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius for easier interpretation. This data is then structured into a Pandas DataFrame to facilitate efficient data manipulation and analysis. For visualization, a bar plot was created using Seaborn to display city-wise temperature variations, enhanced by a “coolwarm” color palette that intuitively represents temperature gradients. The dashboard is well-labeled with appropriate titles, axis labels, and gridlines to improve readability and professional presentation. Importantly, the code includes robust error handling to manage common issues such as invalid API keys or connectivity problems by printing informative error messages and continuing execution for other cities without interruption. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in critical aspects like API integration, JSON parsing, data structuring, and visualization techniques, which are fundamental skills for data science and software development roles. Additionally, this practical work enhanced my understanding of working with RESTful APIs, handling real-world data, and presenting insights visually, thereby aligning perfectly with the internship’s deliverables. The project also lays a solid foundation for future enhancements, such as adding more weather variables, implementing interactive dashboards with advanced Python visualization tools, or integrating predictive models for weather forecasting. Overall, this weather dashboard project not only met the requirements set by the internship at CODTECH but also strengthened my programming and data analysis capabilities, preparing me for more complex challenges in data-driven application development and analytics.
